This package contains some of the utilities from Ian Jackson's private
system `chiark.greenend.org.uk'.

This package, containing the moderately portable sources and Debian
packaging information, and the resulting Debian binary packages, was
put together by Ian, but with assistance from other chiark users.  For
both upstream and Debian packaging questions, please contact
chiark-utils-maint@chiark.greenend.org.uk.


The software included is:

chiark-cryptdisk: encrypted backup drive scripts
