Description: encrypted backup drive scripts
 These are the encrypted backup helper scripts used by various systems
 belonging to the Sinister Greenend Organisation. Features:
  * back up to any random-access block device
  * backups are strongly encrypted using AES
  * contents of backup media are indistinguishable from random data,
    to the casual observer
 .
 This package contains the main utility scripts for creating keys and
 initialising new backup devices. (Recommended: SATA drives
 with hotpluggable caddyless enclosures.)
 .
 WARNING: Merely installing this package does not mean you have achieved 
 encrypted backups! You must set up a cron job to perform the actual backup,
 in whatever format is appropriate. You must also back up the contents
 of /etc/chiark-cryptdisk/keys in some other way. (We suggest creating
 a tarball, encrypting it with GPG -c, and storing it on a USB stick.)
