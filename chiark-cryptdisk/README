1. Teach the scripts how to detect your backup drive.
   This typically means figuring out the kernel module needed 
   See /usr/lib/chiark-cryptdisk/search-for-sata.
   Set the module name in /etc/chiark-cryptdisk/config.

2. Create an initial key with chiark-cryptdisk-make-key
3. Create one or more backup drives using chiark-cryptdisk-initialisedisk.
   We recommend you use the --fill option which fills the encrypted drive
   with zeroes (i.e. what looks to an observer like random data) before
   creating the filesystem on it.
4. Every now and then - perhaps before adding a new drive - roll over to
   a new key, with chiark-cryptdisk-make-key.

XXX TODO: Add hdparm -qf DEVICE and hdparm -Y DEVICE to make it flush and sleep?

Depends: dmsetup, bsdmainutils, cryptsetup

Keys are stored in /etc/chiark-cryptdisk/keys. YOU MUST BACK THIS DIRECTORY UP BY OTHER MEANS; without a copy, you will be unable to read your backups if you ever need to rely on them!
Put it on a USB stick, burn it onto a CD, doesn't quite matter what, but you will need the contents of that directory - along with the scripts in this package - if you need to mount a cryptdisk on another system or restore from it.
