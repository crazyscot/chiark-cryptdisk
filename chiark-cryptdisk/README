=======================================================================
I. Setup

1. Teach the scripts how to detect your backup drive.
   This typically means figuring out the kernel module needed 
   See /usr/lib/chiark-cryptdisk/search-for-sata.
   Set the module name (and your other preferences) in
   /etc/chiark-cryptdisk/config.

2. Create an initial key with chiark-cryptdisk-make-key

3. Create one or more backup drives using chiark-cryptdisk-initialisedisk.
   We recommend you use the --fill option which fills the encrypted drive
   with zeroes (i.e. what looks to an observer like random data) before
   creating the filesystem on it.

4. Every now and then - perhaps before adding a new drive - roll over to
   a new key, with chiark-cryptdisk-make-key.

Keys are stored in /etc/chiark-cryptdisk/keys. YOU MUST BACK THIS
DIRECTORY UP BY OTHER MEANS; without a copy, you will be unable to read
your backups if you ever need to rely on them!  Put it on a USB stick,
burn it onto a CD, doesn't quite matter what, but you will need the
contents of that directory - along with the scripts in this package -
if you need to mount a cryptdisk on another system or restore from it.

=======================================================================
II. Interacting with the encrypted drives

* To mount the drive, run `/usr/lib/chiark-cryptdisk/examine' as root.
  If you want to mount it read-write, add the option `--rw'.

* How you back up your data is up to you, but see below.

* When you are finished, run `/usr/lib/chiark-cryptdisk/umount'.

We provide /usr/lib/chiark-cryptdisk/chiark-cryptdisk-backup[.withlock]
as a suggestion for an integrated backup script, suitable for running from
root's crontab; take careful note of its use of rsync's `--link-dest'
mode.
